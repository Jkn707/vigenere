# Vigenere Cipher Implementation

This project implements the Vigenere cipher for encrypting and decrypting text files using system calls in C++. The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

## Files

- `vigenere.h`: Header file containing the declarations of the Vigenere class and related functions.
- `vigenere.cpp`: Implementation file containing the definitions of the Vigenere class methods and related functions.
- `example.txt`: Example input file to be encrypted and decrypted.

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile the project, use the following command:

```sh
g++ vigenere.cpp -o vigenere
```
